I find coding relaxing. I don't get a lot of time to do it. I get 20 or 30 minutes here and there, sometimes a luxurious hour or two. This game is conducive to those little snippets of time. An animation here. A collsion there. Small wins. Perfect.

Update: 24 February 2020 
I just revisited this project for the first time in several months. It's always been a "get something working" kind of project but now I find that doing something relatively simple takes longer than the 20 minute window I have available to me. 

The functionality is at a state where I can have a little player character run through many randomised rooms and shoot a robot. Good enough. Time to move on to something different.
