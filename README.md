# i am trying to revive an atrophied skill

I used to be ok at this. Pretty ok.

But now something as simple as an agorithm to draw a picture on a screen is harder and takes way longer than I would like.

But practice makes things better and I am practicing.

Practicing what, exactly? 

* Having an idea and starting it
* Finishing what I started 
* Putting things on a screen, taking input, making the things do things, maybe even sounds

Spade is eventually going to be a Shamus like game with automatically generated levels.

Right now I am getting it working. The code will not be great If I get that done I'll probably do something new with better looking code.

One can only hope, right?
